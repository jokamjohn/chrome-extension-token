# Authenticate your chrome extension user through your webÂ app
 This is an accompanying codebase for my post on Medium explaining how to send a message(token)
 from any web application to a Chrome extension.
 
## Folder setup
`chrome-extension`: Contains the extension code
`Frontend`: Contains the web application

## Installation

`chrome-extension`: Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/)

`Frontend`: Navigate to the directory and run `npm i` to install the dependencies and then `npm run start` or `yarn start`
